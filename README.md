## SpamExperts API Library

This library makes common interaction with the SpamExpert API interface easier to use in bash scripts. Currently it only contains functions i've needed myself and might be expanded later.

## Prerequisites

The library only needs Curl to be installed for posting the API calls. Also an API user needs to be made that is allowed to post to the API.

## Settings

Copy the example config from se-lib.cfg-example to se-lib.cfg the first time.

The following settings can be set in the config file:

* filterhosts: the hosts that handle the mail filtering, default: 'filter[1-4].mydomain.tld'
* seapihost: the host that contains the web/API interface, default: filter1.mydomain.tld
* seapiuser: the API user, default: exampleuser
* seapipassword: the API users password, default: mypassword
* date: the date format wanted in the log file, default: $(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)
* deleteconfirmation: ask for confirmation before deleting in the queues, default: true
* logfile: the name of the log file, default: se-lib.log
* msgage: minimal age in seconds of messages in the queues, default: 300
* msgagemax: maximum age in seconds of messages in the queues, this is typically 5 days, default: 432000
